## Note  
As of Wednesday, May 1, 2024, the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub no longer accepted new submissions. Information provided on forecast submissions are kept for historical record.

As of November 2024, the US CDC opened a [new COVID-19 Forecast Hub repository](https://github.com/CDCgov/covid19-forecast-hub).

***

This is the data repository for the [COVID-19 Forecast Hub](https://covid19forecasthub.org/), which is the data source for [the official CDC COVID-19 Forecasting page](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/forecasting/forecasting-math-modeling.html). 

If you are a modeling team interested in submitting to the Hub, please visit our [technical README with detailed submission instructions](https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub/blob/master/data-processed/README.md).

If you are interested in using the forecast data in a research project, you may clone this repo or use our [`covidHubUtils` R package](https://github.com/reichlab/covidHubUtils) to access the data through an API. Participating teams provide their 
[forecasts](https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub/tree/master/data-processed) 
in a [quantile-based format](https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub/blob/master/data-processed/README.md#Data-formatting). Please also follow the data license and citation guidelines below.

If you are a developer interested in the infrastructure here, we encourage you to check out [the Hub documentation wiki](https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub/wiki).
